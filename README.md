# GameOfLife

This repository contains a Game of Life simulation implemented in three programming languages: C++, Java, and Python. 

- The C++ project uses the console to display the entire simulation.
- The Java implementation utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface.
- The Python version utilizes the Pygame framework for visualization.

Feel free to explore each implementation and experiment with the Game of Life simulation in different programming environments!
